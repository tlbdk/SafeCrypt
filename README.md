SafeCrypt
=========

Cleaned up version of AppHarbor.Web.Security with generic interface.

In addition to the original C# implementation of SafeCrypt, this version includes a PHP implementation.
The PHP implementation is fully compatible with the C# implementation, allowing for ASP.NET<>PHP interoperability.
